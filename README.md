# face_recognition
Project on face recognition as part of undergrad coursework.

# collaborators
Anjishnu Mukherjee and Debdeep Nayak

# Dataset
We created our own dataset by writing a python script to extract faces from 
videos of our friends, who gave their permission for us to use the videos for
this purpose. The images so obtained are stored in the Faces folder.

# Brief outline
- *Step 1 : Keypoint Detection and Face Alignment* <br/>
- *Step 2 : Using ResNet50 for embedding faces* <br/>
- *Step 3 : Comparing face encodings using SVM or some other ML algorithm* <br/>
- *Step 4 : Documentation* 

# Accomplished as of yet vs Not done:
- Step 1 -> Keypoint Detection and Buggy code for Alignment (major fixing needed)
- Step 2 -> Buggy Code for Resnet50 written. Possible problems : Need to re-train, Dataloader might need to be written.
- Step 3 -> Not done.
- Step 4 -> Not done.
