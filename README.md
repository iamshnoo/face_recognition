# face_recognition
Project on face recognition as part of undergrad coursework.

# collaborators
Anjishnu Mukherjee and Debdeep Nayak

# Dataset
We created our own dataset by writing a python script to extract faces from 
videos of our friends, who gave their permission for us to use the videos for
this purpose. The images so obtained are stored in the Faces folder.
